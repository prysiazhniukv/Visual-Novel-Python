Young man: (sitting on a train, looking out the window) It's been so long since I've seen Alisa. I wonder what she's been up to.
(the train arrives at the station)
Young man: (getting off the train) I can't believe I'm finally here. (looks around) Where is she?
(Alisa approaches from the doorway)
Alisa: (smiling) Hi!
Young man: (surprised) Alisa! (hugs her) It's so good to see you!
Alisa: (laughing) It's been too long! How have you been?
Young man: (grinning) I've been good. Really good. How about you?
Alisa: (smiling) I've been great. I've missed you so much.
Young man: (getting emotional) I've missed you too. It's been too long since we've seen each other.
Alisa: (putting her arm around him) I know. But we're together now. And that's all that matters.
Young man: (nodding) Yeah. It is.
(They walk off together, chatting and catching up)
